# gRPC Performance

A project to benchmark the performance of gRPC and REST services.  The goal is to help one determine whether they should "Just Use REST" or move to gRPC to take advantage of the performance benefits of gRPC.  Often the best practices with REST help address many of your performance needs.  You can then determine if the move to gRPC is needed.
